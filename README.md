# AnyTestTrainer
The program is designed to pass tests, as well as to learn the correct answers. At the end of the test, all questions with wrong answers are shown, the correct answers are shown in bold.
There is an opportunity to mix up the order of questions and the order of answers.
Tests are loaded into the program in the form of text files, which should be in the same folder with the program.
The test should be located in a file with the .txt extension and have the following appearance:

Test title
1. The text of the question

a) the text of the answer

b) the text of another answer


So far the program recognizes only three tests - test1.txt, test2.txt, test3.txt. The answers to the tests are written in the program, so you can not use this program for any purposes. In the future, it is planned to add the ability to add any tests.
